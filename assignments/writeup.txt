In this course ive learnt basic linux commands, little bit of shell scripting and kernel coding and operations tracing and a lot of fun commands that ive looked up and tried on my own!

cheat sheet for linux commands:
* mkdir <dirname>- makes directory
* cd <dirname>  - directs to current directory
* ls   - lists files
* chmod +x <filename> - gives permission to execute
* ./<filename>   - runs file
* rm filename   - deletes file
*htop
*bptop
*tree
*pwd
*rmdir
*

fun stuff:
* sl    - shows this cute train moving across the terminal window
* cowsay    - shows a cow saying the text typed
* cmatrix    - displays cool hacker-like stuff 
* lolcat    - used, with cowsay, cmatrix,sl etc to make it rainbow colored
* espeak   - the text is read out by a computer voice
* oneko   - cute cat follows the pointer around
* xeyes   - creepy set of eyes track where ur pointer is going
* banner   - writes  a banner
